Article 14 – Equality / Non-Arbitrariness

Answer Logic:

Art. 14 ensures the State cannot act arbitrarily; similar bidders must be treated alike.

Rejecting L1 (Medi Health) without objective, pre-declared reasons = arbitrariness.



1. There must be Intelligible Differentia (clear distinction between those included and excluded).

2. That differentia must have a Rational Nexus with the object sought to be achieved.

Here, L1 (Medi Health) and L2 were both similarly placed bidders. Rejecting L1 without pre-declared grounds breaks this nexus:



If employment generation was the object, the tender must state it upfront.

Using it after evaluation breaks rational nexus between selection criteria and the decision.

Case Laws:

1. E.P. Royappa v. State of Tamil Nadu (1974, SC) – Equality is antithesis of arbitrariness; arbitrariness = inequality.

2. Ramana Dayaram Shetty v. IAAI (1979, SC) – Criteria must be clear and uniformly applied; shifting rules violates rational nexus.
1. ITC Ltd. v. State of U.P. (2011, SC) → Arbitrary State contracts violate Art. 19(1)(g).

2. LIC of India v. Consumer Education & Research Centre (1995, SC) → State contracts must not impose unfair restrictions on business or livelihood.


🏛️ Issue 2: Whether Clause 12.4 (“absolute discretion”) is void under Section 23 of the Contract Act



Petitioner’s Argument (Medi Health)

1. Absolute Discretion = Opposed to Public Policy

Clause 12.4 confers on the State Cabinet unfettered, one-sided discretion to override the Tender Committee.

Such unguided power inevitably leads to arbitrariness, favoritism, and corruption.

Under Section 23 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872, agreements that are opposed to public policy are void.

Case Law:

Central Inland Water Transport v. Brojo Nath Ganguly (1986, SC) → Held that clauses conferring absolute discretion are void as they offend public policy.

Application: Clause 12.4 is precisely such a clause; it is void ab initio.



2. Transparency & Legitimate Expectation

If employment generation was truly the State’s dominant objective, it should have been explicitly declared in the RfP/tender document.

By introducing this criterion after bids were opened, the State shifted the goalposts mid-process.

Medi Health, being L1, had a legitimate expectation that contracts would be awarded on pre-declared evaluation criteria.

Case Law:

ONGC v. SAW Pipes (2003, SC) → “Public policy” encompasses fairness, reasonableness, and absence of arbitrariness.

Application: By altering criteria mid-way, the State acted unfairly and violated the doctrine of legitimate expectation.



3. Post-hoc Justification = Unfairness

“Employment generation” was cited only after evaluation as justification for bypassing L1.

This is a post-hoc justification, not a genuine pre-set objective.

Had Medi Health known, it could have offered 100% employability generation.

This violates equal treatment under Article 14 of the Constitution.

Case Law:

ITC Ltd. v. State of U.P. (2011, SC) → Arbitrary State action in contracts violates Art. 14 & 19(1)(g), and clauses permitting such arbitrariness are void under Sec. 23.

Application: Supports Medi Health — rejection of L1 on undeclared grounds is arbitrary and unconstitutional.



4. One-Sided Power to the State

Clause 12.4 effectively hands the State a blank cheque to override the tender process.

This reduces the evaluation exercise to a sham, making participation by bidders meaningless.

Under Section 23, such one-sided, oppressive clauses are inherently void, regardless of bidder participation.



Anticipated Counter by State & Petitioner’s Rebuttal

Counter: “Counsel, your client knew Clause 12.4 existed before applying. Why did you bid if you disagreed?”

Rebuttal:

1. Acceptance ≠ Validation → Even if bidders signed, a clause void under law cannot be validated (Brojo Nath, 1986).

2. Unequal Bargaining Power → Govt. tenders are non-negotiable contracts of adhesion; bidders cannot delete terms.

3. Hidden Objective → Clause 12.4 itself never mentioned employment generation; invoking it later is misuse of power.

4. Constitutional Supremacy → No clause can override Art. 14 (equality) or Art. 19(1)(g) (freedom of trade). Participation cannot waive constitutional rights.



✅ Final Oral Submission (Petitioner)

“My Lords, Clause 12.4 is void under Section 23 of the Contract Act because it hands the State absolute discretion, which this Court in Brojo Nath (1986) struck down as opposed to public policy. If employment generation was the true objective, it should have been pre-declared; instead, it was invoked after evaluation, depriving my client of a fair chance, despite being L1 and capable of offering even 100% employability generation. By shifting criteria mid-process, the State violated transparency, fairness, and legitimate expectation, principles which ONGC v. SAW Pipes (2003) and ITC Ltd. v. U.P. (2011) affirm are integral to public policy. Clause 12.4, therefore, is arbitrary, unconstitutional, and void ab initio.”


Issue 2: Whether Clause 12.4 (“absolute discretion”) is void under Section 23 of the Contract Act



Petitioner’s Argument (Medi Health)

1. Absolute Discretion ≠ Public Policy

The State may argue that Clause 12.4 gives flexibility in public interest (e.g., for employment generation).

But public interest cannot justify arbitrary, one-sided power.

Public policy ≠ unfettered discretion. It requires decisions to be guided by fairness, transparency, and equality.

Giving the Cabinet unchecked authority converts public policy into personal policy, which the law forbids.

Case Law:

Central Inland Water Transport v. Brojo Nath Ganguly (1986, SC) → Absolute discretion clauses are void under Sec. 23.

Fit: Clause 12.4 does not protect public interest — it destroys it by inviting arbitrariness.



2. Transparency & Legitimate Expectation

If “employment generation” was truly a public interest objective, it should have been clearly stated in the tender itself.

Instead, it was introduced post-bid, defeating transparency.

Medi Health had a legitimate expectation that evaluation would be on pre-declared criteria (L1 principle).

Case Law:

ONGC v. SAW Pipes (2003, SC) → Public policy = fairness + reasonableness.

Fit: Using Clause 12.4 after evaluation is unfair, unreasonable, and against public policy.



3. Post-Hoc Justification = Unfairness

“Employment generation” was not an original criterion — it was used as a post-hoc justification to bypass L1.

Medi Health could have offered 100% employability generation if this was pre-declared.

Clause 12.4 thus becomes a tool for unfair treatment under Art. 14.

Case Law:

ITC Ltd. v. State of U.P. (2011, SC) → Arbitrary State actions in contracts violate Art. 14 & 19(1)(g) and are void under Sec. 23.

Fit: Clause 12.4 permitted such arbitrariness.



4. One-Sided Power is Void Regardless of Intent

Even if public interest is cited, Clause 12.4 remains void because:



It is one-sided (blank cheque to the State).

It lacks checks & balances.

It defeats equal treatment of bidders.

Under Sec. 23, one-sided clauses are inherently void, even if dressed up as “public interest.”
