Case Brief: Air India Ltd. v. Cochin International Airport Ltd., (2000)

Citation: MANU/SC/3402/2000, 2000 INSC 39
Coram: G.T. Nanavati, S.N. Phukan, JJ.

✅ Facts:

CIAL (Cochin International Airport Ltd.), a PSU, invited offers for ground-handling services.

Bids received from Cambatta Aviation, Air India, DNATA, Ogden.

Evaluation Committee found Cambatta and Air India best; recommended Cambatta.

Government of India & CIAL Board later preferred Air India, citing its position as a national carrier and ability to increase traffic.

Cambatta challenged award → Single Judge dismissed writ → Division Bench allowed appeal (held CIAL acted arbitrarily).

Air India & CIAL appealed to the Supreme Court.

✅ Issues:

Whether CIAL’s decision to award contract to Air India was arbitrary, unreasonable, or mala fide?

Whether the High Court was justified in interfering under Article 226?

✅ Held (Supreme Court):

Award of contracts by State or PSUs is a commercial decision; judicial review is limited.

Price is not the sole criterion; overall commercial considerations can be taken into account.

State/PSUs must act fairly and not arbitrarily, but Courts should interfere only if mala fides, arbitrariness, or unreasonableness are proven.

Here, CIAL bona fide believed that involving Air India (national carrier, PSU, long-term benefits) was more advantageous.

Division Bench erred; Single Judge’s decision restored.

✅ Principles Laid Down:

Judicial Review in Contract Matters:

Court does not sit as an appellate authority in commercial decisions.

It examines only the decision-making process, not the merits of the decision.

Interference is justified only when decision is mala fide, arbitrary, or against public interest.

Commercial Considerations:

State is not bound to accept highest/lowest bid.

Negotiations and preference to a PSU/national carrier may be valid if bona fide.

Article 226:

High Courts must exercise caution and interfere only in larger public interest.

✅ Outcome:

Appeals allowed.

Contract in favour of Air India upheld.

Kerala High Court Division Bench judgment set aside.
