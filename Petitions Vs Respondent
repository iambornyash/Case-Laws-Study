PETITIONER ARGUMENTS (Medi Health Pvt. Ltd.)

Hon’ble Supreme Court, Your Lordships,

May it please the Court, we appear on behalf of the Petitioner, Medi Health Pvt. Ltd., challenging the award of the Government Hospital contract to Care Well Constructions Ltd. despite the Petitioner being the lowest bidder (L1) and meeting all technical criteria.

I. Violation of Article 14 (Right to Equality / Non-Arbitrariness)

Fundamental Principle: Article 14 guarantees equality before the law and prohibits arbitrary discrimination.

Tender Evaluation: L1 fulfilled all conditions and quoted the lowest bid (₹790 cr), while L2 (₹815 cr) was awarded the contract.

Arbitrariness in Deviation: The sole reason cited—“policy preference for local employment”—is not codified in tender criteria, hence arbitrary.

Judicial Precedent:

Union of India v. Hindustan Development Corporation (1990): Discretion must not be exercised arbitrarily or capriciously.

Tata Cellular v. Union of India (1994): Government cannot deviate from transparent tender procedure for extraneous reasons.

Impact: This decision results in financial burden on public funds (₹25 cr higher bid) without lawful justification.

II. Violation of Article 19(1)(g) (Right to Practice Any Profession/Trade)

Commercial Right: Tender participation is a profession/trade under Article 19(1)(g).

Unreasonable Exclusion: L1 was excluded despite being eligible, violating Petitioner’s right to earn through legitimate contract opportunities.

Precedent: Tata Cellular v. Union of India supports that government cannot unreasonably exclude a qualified bidder.

III. Invalidity of Clause 12.4 under Section 23, Contract Act, 1872

Absolute Discretion Clause: Clause 12.4 allows rejection of any bid “without reasons.”

Uncertainty & Public Policy: Section 23 invalidates agreements whose consideration or object is unlawful or against public policy.

Case Law:

Fisher v. Bell (1961): Agreements giving arbitrary power void as against public policy.

Central Inland Water Transport Corp. v. Brojo Nath Ganguly (1986): Public authority powers must be exercised reasonably.

Effect: Clause 12.4 enables arbitrary rejection, breaching rule of law and undermining fairness.

IV. Writ Jurisdiction (Articles 32 & 226) Applies

Judicial Review: Arbitrary award of contracts is amenable to writ petitions.

Precedent:

Ajay Hasia v. Khalid Mujib (1981): Acts of government bodies affecting fundamental rights are reviewable.

Conclusion: High Court erred in dismissing petition, assuming policy discretion is beyond review.

V. Public Fund Mismanagement

Awarding a higher bid (₹815 cr) increases public expenditure unnecessarily.

Petitioner’s award would optimize use of public funds while meeting project objectives.

PRAYER (Petitioner)

Declare award to L2 illegal and arbitrary.

Direct State to award contract to Medi Health Pvt. Ltd. (L1) in accordance with tender terms.

Declare Clause 12.4 void to prevent future misuse.

Any other relief deemed fit by this Hon’ble Court.

RESPONDENT ARGUMENTS (State of Wellesley / Care Well Constructions Ltd.)

Hon’ble Supreme Court, Your Lordships,

May it please the Court, we appear on behalf of the Respondent, defending the award to Care Well Constructions Ltd. (L2).

I. Policy Discretion under Tender / PPP Model

Clause 12.4: Expressly allows government to reject bids at its discretion.

Rationale: Preference for local employment is a legitimate public policy objective under PPP for socio-economic development.

Precedent:

R. Gandhi v. State of Tamil Nadu (2002): Policy decisions in awarding public contracts are within government discretion.

Conclusion: No mala fide intention; discretionary choice is reasonable and legal.

II. No Violation of Article 14

Reasonable Classification: L2 selected for stronger local employment potential; policy objective justifies deviation from lowest-bid principle.

Judicial Support:

State of UP v. Dhaniram (1963): Reasonable classification consistent with Article 14 is valid.

Argument: Article 14 prohibits arbitrary action, not reasonable, policy-based discretion.

III. Clause 12.4 Validity

Discretion Not Unlawful: Section 23 invalidates only agreements against public policy, not reasonable administrative discretion.

PPP Contracts: BOT model inherently allows flexibility in bidder selection to safeguard public interest.

Precedent: Bharat Sanchar Nigam Ltd. v. Telecommunication Employees Union (2000): Administrative discretion recognized.

IV. Article 19(1)(g) Not Violated

Participation in tender does not confer absolute right to contract.

Government retains authority to evaluate bids considering broader public policy objectives.

V. High Court Correctly Dismissed Petition

Judicial review cannot substitute administrative judgment for policy decisions.

No arbitrariness or mala fide intent found.

PRAYER (Respondent)

Dismiss the Petition with costs.

Uphold award to Care Well Constructions Ltd. (L2).

Declare Clause 12.4 constitutionally valid.

Any other relief as this Hon’ble Court may deem fit.
